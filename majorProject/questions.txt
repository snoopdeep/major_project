Got it — you're feeding this document into a **vector database** for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**! 🔥  
I'll give you a list of **good, sharp questions** that would **trigger retrieval** based on the content you posted. I'll mix **simple**, **moderate**, and **deep** questions to cover different levels of testing your system:

Would you also like me to give you **some advanced "multi-hop" questions**?  
(These require combining 2–3 pieces of info from different parts of the doc — useful if you want to test more **reasoning** with RAG!) 🚀

Want me to prepare those too? 🎯
